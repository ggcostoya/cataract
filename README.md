## Why *Cataract*? 

This all falls down on the developer of this repository (@ggcostoya) being the geekiest Marvel fan there is. [**SPOILER WARNING**] Within Disney+'s *Wandavison*, Project **Cataract**  is the initiative to bring the Avenger **Vision** back to life. If you remember from *Avengers: Infinity War*, Vision carries in his forehead the *Mind stone*, one of the six infinity stones that Thanos so desperately wants. As a matter of fact, Vision's stone is the last one Thanos needs in order to have the power to eliminate half of all living creatures. That is why when Thanos finds him during the battle of Wakanda, to put it in the nicest possible way, he rubbs his forhead really hard and he ends up getting the stone, leaving Vision's head a little bit lighter in the process. However, Vision's body (minus stone and 75% of the head) is recovered, and during the events of "Wandavision" a bit of Scarlet Witch's magic is used to bring it back to life, now without memories from his past life and looking white and creepy. The new **White Vision** is sent to the town of **Westview** to kill both the Scarlett Witch and the version of Vision she created in her grief. Before White Vision is able to complete his mission, **Wanda's Vision** is able to convince him not to do it by unlocking his memories from before Thanos.
