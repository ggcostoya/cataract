### **Why _Cataract_?** 

This all falls down on the developer of this repository (@ggcostoya) being the geekiest Marvel fan there is. Within Disney+'s *Wandavison*, Project **Cataract**  is the initiative to bring the Avenger **Vision** back to life. One of the recommendations I give in this repository is to name your projects with a single word that is both informative of what is going and funny or interesting enough to motivate you to work on it. I think that `cataract` is awesome so that's the name I chose OKAY? Don't judge me daaamn.
