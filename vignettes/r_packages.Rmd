### **Aim of the Game**

Have you ever been in that situation where your R script is painfully long? Something like: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# first remove everything on the environment
rm(list = ls())

# then install the packages you need 
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("nlmer")
install.packages("rethinking")
install.packages("whatever")
install.packages("some bullshit I need 4 just that one line")

# then load the packages 
library(ggplot2)
library(nlmer)
library(rethinking)
library(whatever)
library(some bullshit I need 4 just that one line)

# then load the data 
data <- read.csv(C:/was_it_this_folder?/within_this_one?/not_sure/maybe_here?/data.csv)

# then tidy the raw data and only keep what you need for your analysis 
actual_data <- data.frame(unicorn_id = data$UniCorn_Identity,
                          horn_length = data$Length_of_THe_horn_of_the_UNicorn, 
                          weight = data$W_of_the_Unicorn_when_born)

# to then finally be able to run the fricking analysis 
model <- lm(horn_length ~ weight, actual_data)

# to then get a fricking ERROR AGAIN GODDAMN IT! 

```
<br> 

Installing packages, loading them, cleaning data, preparing it for analysis, doing the analysis and plotting the results all within the same file can result in absurdly long `R` scripts. There is a way to solve this and it is by treating your entire research project as an **`R` package**. Let me explain: 

### **What is an `R` package?**

An **`R` package** is a type of **`R` project**, in other words, a way to work with `R` on a specific topic. A package, just like any project, is set up from a folder in your computer that you set up where you store all your files and data. If you develop your own `R` package it will work similarly to those packages you install and load every time you run an `R` script (i.e `ggplot2`, `nlmer` etc.) when you need a function that does something useful, only this time, you will be the person behind the scenes! 

A package can include, **functions**, **data**, and all kinds of scripts to process or document your work. As an example, I have developed the package `cataract` por the EcoLunch presentation. I can load this package and with it I can specify other packages that need to be both installed and loaded with it with the function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```
<br> 

When loading the package I can also access functions that I have written myself to perform specific tasks. For example, here is a function that generates facts about **Chris H.** with different degrees (1-5) of spicyness:

```{r}
generate_chris_fact(spicyness = 3)
```
<br>
I can also access any data sets I am working with. I can actually save them after being processed and with the variables I want so when I load them they are ready to be played with. As an example, I have added some **avengers** data  to the `cataract` project: 

```{r}
# just typing the dataset's name when the package is loaded will make the data pop up!
avengers
```

<br>

And this is just the tip of the iceberg of the things you can do with your `R` package! Would you be interested in creating one for yourself? Here are some tips: 

### **Creating your own `R` package**

*Okay dude but how in the hell do you actually do this?* No problem! Here is a step by step tutorial for you: 

##### **Step 1**

Have you ever noticed when you open Rstudio that little **R** sign that says something like `Project:(None)`. Click there and go to `New Project`.

</center>
<br>

##### **Step 2**

Then this window will pop up, we want a `New Directory`.

<br>

</center>
<br>

##### **Step 3**

Here we will choose `R package`. 

<br>

![](images/rpak_project_type.png){width=600}
</center>
<br>

##### **Step 4**

Which will open this:

<br>
<center>
![](images/rpak_create_package.png){width=600}
</center>
<br>

Three things to consider here: 

* 1. **Name of your package**: Package naming needs to meet certain formalities. In this link: https://r-pkgs.org/workflows101.html?q=namin#naming you will find them as well as some pragmatic advice on naming. My personal recommendation is to name your packages with a **single word** that is descriptive enough and that motivates you to work on it. What I do is name my packages using extremely geeky associations which are related with what the package is about in a funny way. 

* 2. **Make sure you create the folder for the package on a directory you know!**: You can set it up on your Desktop, that's fine! But remember it is there!. What I recommend, as kind of a technological tidiness nerd is to create a specialized folder for `projects` where you can locate all your work!

* 3. **Don't forget about `GIT`!** You should have **GIT** installed in your computer right now (if not go to: https://ggcostoya.github.io/cataract/articles/git.html and check how to do it). If you indeed have it, a little check box with `Create git repository` should appear in this screen. Be sure to check that box! It will be essential later. 

Once you are done, click on `Create Project` and **KABOOM!** Congrats! You've created your first `R` package, now it's time to see what is going on here. 

### **Elements of your `R` package**

As soon as you create your `R` package you will see that a bunch of folders automatically appear on the folder for it. You can see these in the lower right-hand panel in Rstudio where it says `Files`, it should look something like this: 

<br>
<center>
![](images/rpak_files.png){width=600}
</center>
<br>

Among these files and documents the ones you got to pay attention to are: 

#### **`.Rproj`**

The `.Rproj` file is the source to all of your `R` package. In this case, as an example, I've created the `kurama` package so in the picture above you see `kurama.Rproj`. When you create projects of your own the `.Rproj` file will be your package's name. If you go to the folder where you created the package and click on it an `R` session with your package name will appear. Notice also that on the top right hand side it doesn't say `Project:(None)` anymore! The name of your package should appear up there. 

#### **`DESCRIPTION`**

The `DESCRIPTION` file contains all the information related to your project. If you open it, it should look like this: 

```{r,eval = FALSE}
Package: kurama # here's my example, but here the name of your package will appear. 
Type: Package
Title: What the Package Does (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
License: What license is it under?
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

The `DESCRIPTION` file can include all **Dependencies**, which are all packages that need to be installed and loaded for your package to run. You will need to add them manually. You can also add information about the package (title, author, description etc.). As an example, here is the `DESCRIPTION` file for `cataract`: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Package: cataract
Type: Package
Title: Project Cataract
Version: 1.0
Author: Guillermo Garcia Costoya
Maintainer: Guillermo Garcia Costoya <guille@nevada.unr.edu>
Description: A quick guide on how to use GIT, R packages, GitHub and GitHub pages
    as part of your research process to keep your files and data tidy, tracked, organized
    and kewl. A package develop to complement the April 30th 2021 EcoLunch talk by 
    Guillermo Garcia Costoya at the EECB program of the University of Nevada, Reno
License: What license is it under?
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Depends:  ## Here you will need to specify the packages you want to be installed and loaded!
    R(>= 3.3.0),
    tidyverse,
    devtools,
    DescTools, 
    gridExtra,
    here
RoxygenNote: 7.1.1 ## Do me a favor and add this as well if you are copy pasting. It's for your own good. 

```

Setting up a `DESCRIPTION` file like this saves you the trouble of having to install and load packages every time. You just need to include them as *Dependencies* and **BOOM!** They will be loaded every time you load your `R` package!

#### **`\R`**

The `\R` folder will contain all the functions for your package. If you click there as soon as you create your package you'll see that `R` has automatically created a function called `hello`, which is saved on the `hello.R` file that looks like this: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Hello, world!
#
# This is an example function named 'hello' 
# which prints 'Hello, world!'.
#
# You can learn more about package authoring with RStudio at:
#
#   http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
#
# Some useful keyboard shortcuts for package authoring:
#
#   Install Package:           'Ctrl + Shift + B'
#   Check Package:             'Ctrl + Shift + E'
#   Test Package:              'Ctrl + Shift + T'

hello <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```
<br>
The goal here is that you create functions for yourself to make tasks easier and more repeatable. Writing your own functions is a way to avoid repetitions and keep your code short. For example, let's say that for the `avengers` data set I showed you earlier I want to determine who would win in a fight between **Vision** and **Thor**:

```{r}
# let's check the data first once again: 
avengers
```

```{r}
# filter the data to keep only data for vision and thor 
avg_vision_thor <- filter(avengers, name %in% c("vision", "thor"))
# keep the avenger with the highest power value 
winner <- filter(avg_vision_thor, power == max(power))
# extract the name of the winner 
name_winner <- as.character(winner$name)
# and here's the winner! VISION! of course... 
name_winner
```

```{r}
# what if I needed to know who would win between scarlett witch and hulk? 
# Redo the entire shannanigan again? HELL NO! 
# I can write a function to automate this process. I can call this function "match_avengers": 

match_avengers <- function(avg_1, avg_2){
  # avg_1 and avg_2 are the arguments of the function,
  # filter avenger data and keep only two specified avengers as well as the most powerful one
  match <- avengers %>% filter(name %in% c(avg_1, avg_2)) %>% filter(power == max(power))
  # get the name of the winner
  winner <- as.character(match$name)
  return(winner)
}
# let's test the function out! SCARLETT WITCH ALL DAY!! 
match_avengers("scarlett witch", "hulk")
```
<br>
If you check the `\R` folder for the `cataract` package here: https://github.com/ggcostoya/cataract/tree/master/R , you'll see that one of the files there is for the `match_avengers` function. If it is there I can use the function any time `cataract` is loaded! 

#### **`.gitignore`**

The `.gitignore` file will specify which files or folders you don't want `GIT` tracking version-control style. For example, a good addition to `.gitignore` is the `.Rproj` file, it will never change, why keep track of it? 

### **Elements you NEED TO ADD to your `R` package**

Although the package would work with the basic stuff that is generated when you created, to upgrade your `R` package to the next level you'll need to create the following folders: 

#### **`\raw_data`**

In the `\raw_data` folder you will save all data that comes fresh from the field or the lab. I am talking about those messy excels, `.txt` files, `.csv` files anything! All in there. The `\raw_data` folder will also contain what I call **cleaning scripts**. These will have all the data processing, filtering and cleaning necessary for your raw data to become the actual data you'll use in your scripts. 

If you go to: https://github.com/ggcostoya/cataract/tree/master/raw_data, you'll be to see the raw data for the `cataract`. As an example I have included some `meerkats` data a friend of mine used for a project a couple of years ago. Below is an an example **cleaning script** (called `meerkats_data_prep.R`):


```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Meerkat data preparation
library(here) # load here package
meerkats <- read.table(file.path(here(), "raw_data", "meerkats.txt")) # load the raw meerkat data
# rename some columns to make analysis easier
meerkats <- data.frame(obs_feeds = meerkats$observedNfeeds,
                       obs_hours = meerkats$observedhours,
                       r_2_brood = meerkats$relatedness2brood,
                       group_id = meerkats$socialgroupID,
                       brood_id = meerkats$broodID,
                       delta_mass = meerkats$massChange)

# save meerkat data in "data" folder
save(meerkats, file = file.path(here::here(), "data", "meerkats.RData"))
```
<br> 

As you see above, I am reading it, renaming some variables to make it look prettier and easier to handle when running stats on it and finally I am saving it in the `\data` folder, which I'll talk about next: 

#### **`\data`**

The `\data` folder will contain the actual data you will use in your scripts (in `.RData` format) and will be available to you immediately after you load your `R` package. As an example, I can take a look at the `meerkats` data without having to load anything because it is saved in the `data` folder! 

```{r}
head(meerkats)
```
<br>

#### **`\sandbox`**

And finally, the `\sandbox` is where you will save all those scripts in which you are trying out stuff. This is a **personal recommendation** of mine; a folder where you can save all your playing around with models and data.

### **Where did you find all this?** 

Everything I have explained is extracted from the book "**`R` packages**" by the most awesome **Hadley Wickham**, the head developer for Rstudio and co-author of packages as awesome as `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `pkgdown` etc. The book is absolutely free and you can find it here: https://r-pkgs.org/. It has soo many more awesome things I did not develop here! Feel free to check it out!
