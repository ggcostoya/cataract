### **Okay, point, get to the damn, what is GitHub?** 

Now that you (hopefully) have an idea of what **GIT** is (if not, check https://ggcostoya.github.io/cataract/articles/git.html beforehand!),  it is time to talk about the tool that makes version control easy to use: **GitHub**. **GitHub** is a source code managing website that allows you to store and version control any coding projects you have. If you are in this section I encourage you explore https://github.com/ggcostoya/cataract. This link will take you to the GitHub repository of `cataract`, the name I gave to the project associated with the Ecolunch talk. Here is how that page looks like:

The most awesome thing about **GitHub** is that it is an **open source** collaborative platform. In it you can create your own profile, follow people and most importantly **check the source code** for functions you are working with. For example, I am pretty sure that most of you have heard about `ggplot2` at some point right? Well, `ggplot2` is an R package developed by God, I mean, **Hadley Wickham**. We can go to Hadley's profile (conviniently his username is *hadley*): https://github.com/hadley

</center>
<br>

And check for the source code of the `tidyverse/ggplot2` repository: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2, which, as you can see if you click the link, is much more complicated than mine. Once we are there we can search for the actual code of functions that we use a lot, for example, the actual code for the `geom_boxplot` function: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/R/geom-boxplot.r. It is right there with complete open access for anyone, you can even dowload it and modify it yourself if you want to for free! 


### **Use GitHub for your paper's supplementary materials**

A very common use of GitHub to store and present the supplementary materials of your paper. Here is an example by another idol of mine **Richard McElreath**. He published a paper in *Human Nature* in 2014 titled *Using Miltivelel Models to Estimate Variation in Foraging Returns* (you can check it out here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12110-014-9193-4.pdf, it is pretty cool actually) and he provides all code and data he used in his GitHub page: https://github.com/rmcelreath/mcelreath-koster-human-nature-2014. Here's how it looks: 

<br>

![](images/github_mcelreath.png)

<br>

Pretty simple: the code he used (`model_fitting_code.R`), the data he used (`hunting.csv`) and the supplementary materials (`Supplemental.pdf`). All available for anyone to use and recheck that he did good science. I can even dowload his data for myself include it in my own package and check it out! Here is a sample of it! Cool right? 

```{r}

### **Using GitHub in Combination with an R package** 

**!!** Check https://ggcostoya.github.io/cataract/articles/r_packages.html before reading this section if you haven't yet!

Considering what we have been talking about around here, the natural progression is to combine GitHub with your R package workflow. As an example, I have made public one of the R package I have been working on as part of my PhD. research, code name **LimÃ³n**: https://github.com/ggcostoya/limon

### **How do I do this? Connect GitHub with your R package**

Here is a step by step tutorial on how to do it: 

#### **Step 1 : Dowload GIT**

If you haven't already, dowload **GIT** in your computer! You'll find the link here: https://ggcostoya.github.io/cataract/articles/git.html 

#### **Step 2: Create an R package**

If you haven't done it already create one, here are some instructions: https://ggcostoya.github.io/cataract/articles/r_packages.html 

#### **Step 3: Make sure your R package is using GIT**

This should work automatically but just to be sure check that your package is using **GIT** as your version control system. To check it go to: `Tools` (upper bar of options next to `Profile` and `Help`) -> `Version Control` -> `Project Setup` -> `SVN/GIT` -> select **git** as the version control system. 

This might ask you to initialize a new git repo and restart Rstudio, that is totally fine.

#### **Step 4: Create a GitHub account**

Go to: https://github.com. The instructions are super easy to follow and in the process you will find much more information than I could ever provide here. 

#### **Step 5: Connect GitHub and your computer**

This is, by far, the most confusing bit. I understand this might sound intimidating but just be calm, it's going to be okay. If you have any trouble doing this I am happy to help, come visit me at the Logan Lab and we will figure it out! Here's what you need to do

* Let's start by opening **GitBash**, a program that you automatically dowloaded when you got git

* We will need to generate an **SSH key**, which is the key that connects your computer to version control repositories like GitHub. To do so, follow the instructions explained here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

*IMPORTANT*: If you have worked with GitHub before you might already have an SSH key, here are some instructions to check if you already have one:https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys

* Finaly, you will need to tell GitHub about your SSH key so your computer can interact with it, you can do so following these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

#### **Step 6: Create a Repository on GitHub**

GitHub will offer you that possibility when you are setting up your account. Do it! For now, it doesn't matter if the repository is public of private but in the future it will so, as a trial run, keep it public. Also, remember to pick the same name as the one you used for your R package. GitHub will open a page like this, **DO NOT CLOSE IT**, you will need that later:

<br>


#### **Step 7: Connect your R package to your GitHub repository**

This is also a tricky part, I know it is scary but you will have to use the terminal. No worries! I'll show you how: 

* First, open an Rstudio session with your R package. 

* Second, on the lower left hand panel next to `Console` there should be a label for `Terminal`. Go there. 

* To initialise **GIT** in our R package on that terminal we are going to type: 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git init
```

*IMPORTANT*: Be careful with the spacing! You are typing *git* commands and the spaces between words are important! 

* Then we are going to make our first **Commit**, remember that a commit is tracking any changes occuring in the files of your package. At first, the commit will track  all files that were generated when you created your R package. To commit type the follwing in the terminal: 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git commit -m "first commit"
```

* Now add the first commit to **GIT** (The space between `add` and `.` here is very important!)

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add .
```

* Finally, to **push** the commit to **GitHub** type:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git push -u "SSH key from GitHub"
```

Above where it says "*SSH key from GitHub*" you will need to copy the **SSH key** of your GitHub repository. Remember when I told you not to close the page that poped up when you created the GitHub repository? Here's where it comes to play! You'll find that SSH key here:

</center>
<br>

If everything has gone correctly the files from your R project should now appear on your GitHub repository! Awesome! 

#### **Step 8: Working with Git + Rpackages + GitHub consistently **

If you go back to Rstudio you should see on the upper right hand pannel a tab called `Git`. That pannel will allow you to track any changes (modifications, additions, deletions etc.) that you make to your files. You will be able to select the changes you want for a particular **commit** as well as having the option to **Push** those commits to GitHub as well as  **Pull**ing any changes you've made through GitHub directly.
