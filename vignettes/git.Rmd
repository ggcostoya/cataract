#### **Okay, cut to the chase, WTF is GIT?** 

Haven't we all been in that situation where our folder with all the code files for our project looks a little bit like this?:

Keeping track of all changes we make in our work is hard! Sometimes we have multiple files and the difference between them only falls to one or two lines of code that actually do the trick and make our model work. **Why save an entire new file if only a line or two are different?** Is there a way to only record these changes? Funny you ask! There is! And it is called **Version Control**.

**Version control** is a class of system used mostly for software engineering that allows us to manage changes within our software and **GIT** is one of these systems. 

#### **But how does GIT work?** 

The first thing to understand how **GIT** works is the concept of a **Commit**. A **commit is the recording any modifications you make to existing files** generating in the process a new version of the original/s. A commit can include a single or multiple files even full folders and it accounts for not only modifications but also additions or deletions within the file. Below I add an graph schematic of what a commit is, for now it is quite simple, but I'll add a bunch of levels of complexity so be sure you are rock solid before jumping to the next step.

The next important concept to understand is **Repository**. A **repository is the project that is being held under version control, all the files or folders whose modifications will be tracked**. A repository is equivalent to your entire project. 

Complementarily, another improtant idea is that of the **Push**. A **push is a single or multiple commits that establish a new version of your repository**. 

Two other important concepts to understand here are **Repository** and he **Push**. A push is a

#### **Could you give a real world example?**
